This project is a Python-based media transcription tool built on top of OpenAI’s Whisper model. It is designed to automatically convert speech from both audio and video files into accurate text transcripts. With support for a wide range of file formats including MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A, MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, and WMV, the tool ensures flexibility and convenience for different use cases. The script can process a single file or recursively scan entire directories to detect and transcribe all supported media files, making it suitable for both small and large-scale transcription tasks. The output can be saved in two formats: plain text (.txt) for quick readability or structured JSON (.json) for integration with other applications. It leverages Whisper’s “tiny” model by default, enabling faster execution while still providing reliable results. The implementation also integrates FFmpeg to ensure compatibility with a variety of media encodings. This makes it an ideal solution for students, researchers, content creators, and professionals who want a lightweight, open-source transcription tool. Future enhancements can include support for larger Whisper models, command-line arguments for customization, and advanced features such as speaker diarization, timestamps, and multilingual transcription support.
